            Expertise        
        </h2>
        <p>
            Coming to Canada has really been beneficial for my personal growth. It has allowed me to become very 
            responsible, hardworking, and dedicated about my future. After doing many volunteering hours at 
            Salvation Army in my city Scarborough. That helped me how to communicate with a customer and 
            improve critical thinking skills as I had to deal with new ideas and schemes to attract customers. Then I 
            started an online certificate to improve my leadership skills which has proven very beneficial to me. 
            Later, I worked at Burger King as a cashier that taught me how to deal with everyone politely and 
            respectfully under heavy pressure. In my off time I started learning computer skills that made me very 
            fluent with softwareâ€™s like, Adobe, Word, Excel, Google Docs, sheets, slides, Linux, Unix, making me 
            flexible and familiar with all the latest programs and softwares in the computer.
